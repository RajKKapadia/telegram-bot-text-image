# Telegram chat-bot
Hi everyone, this is repository for my personal demo project on connecting Telegram and OpenAI to provide answers to all the users questions using OpenAI GPT-3. This is written in `Python` and served with `Flask`. This bot can only handle:
* receive text message generate image from it using Openai and send it back
* it has a built-in menu options as well

You can interact with this bot [here](http://t.me/askme_anything_bot).

### Youtube
I have recorded a quick video on the setup of this chat-bot, in case you want to replicate the work, you can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/AdfQAbzxw30).

### What you will need
There are couple of things that you need before you get started following this repository.
* OpenAI API key, since it is open to all, you can create an account [here](https://openai.com/) and access the key.
* You need a telegram bot API key as well, you can get it with interacting with Botfather on Telegeram [here](). Alternatively, you can one of my video on how to create a Telegram bor [here](https://youtu.be/oBQMPmCVY8c).
* Mongodb Atlas account for saving all the messages to mongodb.
* API requesting application like Postman, Insomnia, etc.
* NGROK for local testing.

To replicate the work of this repository and run it locally, you need to follow these steps:
* create a `.env` file inside the root directory, create these environmental variables:
